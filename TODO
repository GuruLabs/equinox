doctest doesn't test Cython properties
Add exclude= for all()/iteritems()
Clearly define extension/inheritance API
Disallow empty Element name
Include encoding in <?xml
Don't escape " -> &quot; in Text()
Re-evaluate Element.attrs():
  - iteritems = iterattrs -> iter([(k,v), ...])
  - items     = attrs     ->      [(k,v), ...]
  - It'd be nice have a method that returns a dict,
    attrs() seems like the right name.
